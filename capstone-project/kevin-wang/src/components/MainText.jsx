                While America has long been dominated by cars, public transportation is still important and can help tackle many of the problems that America faces today.
                Public transportation can help reduce the carbon footprint of America, as well as reduce congestion on roads. It can also help reduce the cost of living
                for many Americans, as many people are unable to afford a car, and public transportation can help them get to work. Finally, public transit is an affordable
                and efficient way to reach many health services.

                Unfortunately, America has invested little into public transportation infrasturcture, and as a result, the American transit system lacks behind its European and Asian
                counterparts.

                This is quite evident in the map below that shows the percentage of workers from 2020 in each county that use public transportation to get to work. The only
                counties that have a significant percentage of workers that use public transportation are the counties that contain New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco.
                Everywhere else in America, the percentage of workers that use public transportation is quite low.

                Unemployment is also included because while it is a complicated issue that is caused by numerous different factors, it is an interesting enterprise to see
                if there exists some link between public transportation and unemployment. For more information on this potential relationship, there is a bar graph that
                shows the unemployment rate and public transit usage in 2020 for each county in America.

                For further exploration in the progress of public transportation in America, there is also a line graph that shows the change in public transit usage from 2010 - 2020 among workers
                in each county.
